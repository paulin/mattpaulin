# Building and Scaling a Public Health Platform Under Extreme Time Pressure
## Executive Case Study: Signetic

## Situation: Public Health Software in a Crisis Environment

Signetic was a startup focused on vaccination management software, spun out of Leapfrog Technology.  
Originally built to support flu vaccination programs, the platform was rapidly repurposed during COVID-19 and became the system used by the City of Seattle and surrounding regions to operate large-scale mass vaccination events, including Lumen Field.

The operating environment was defined by:
- A global public health emergency
- Government and public health stakeholders with near-zero tolerance for failure
- Rapidly evolving policy and reporting requirements
- Intense public visibility and trust risk

This was not a typical startup context — **product decisions directly affected public safety, equity, and public trust**.

## The Real Problem (Not the Obvious One)

The obvious problem appeared to be:

> “How do we build software to schedule and manage vaccinations?”

The real problem was:

> **How do we create a platform that public health agencies can trust to operate reliably at scale, under uncertainty, while serving diverse and underserved populations?**

Failure modes were concrete:
- Missed or duplicate appointments wasted scarce doses
- Confusing UX excluded elderly and non-technical users
- Reporting errors eroded confidence with state and federal agencies

---

## Constraints That Defined the Work

Signetic operated under unusually severe constraints:

- **Time pressure:** Capabilities were delivered in days and weeks, not quarters
- **Scale volatility:** Traffic spiked unpredictably based on supply and eligibility changes
- **Stakeholder complexity:** Cities, counties, pharmacies, and public health districts
- **Equity requirements:** Access for elderly, homebound, and underserved communities
- **Business uncertainty:** Pandemic-driven demand followed by rapid market contraction

Every roadmap decision was shaped by these realities.

## Key Leadership and Product Decisions

### 1. Position Signetic as a managed vaccination solution, not just software

Rather than selling a self-serve SaaS tool, Signetic was intentionally positioned as a **managed vaccination platform**:
- Software paired with operational support
- Clear accountability during live vaccination events
- Hands-on coordination with public health partners

This framing reduced adoption friction and increased trust with municipalities.

---

### 2. Prioritize operational reliability over feature expansion

Product decisions consistently favored:
- Stability over experimentation
- Simple, repeatable workflows over customization
- Proven operational flows over speculative features

This reduced risk during live events serving tens of thousands of people per day.

---

### 3. Design explicitly for real-world access and equity

UX and product choices accounted for:
- Low technical literacy
- Device and bandwidth constraints
- Language and accessibility needs

The goal was not elegance, but **broad and fair access**.

---

### 4. Continuously reassess the market as conditions changed

As vaccination demand declined:
- Addressable market assumptions were revisited
- Pharmacy and subscription-based models were tested
- Leadership confronted the limits of pandemic-era growth expectations

Not every expansion effort succeeded, but decisions were revisited quickly and transparently.

## Outcomes & Signals

- Platform supported **~415,000 COVID vaccinations**
- Enabled successful operation of large-scale public vaccination sites
- Earned sustained trust from public health agencies during peak crisis
- Demonstrated the ability to scale rapidly under extreme load
- Surfaced structural challenges in sustaining demand post-pandemic

Just as importantly, the experience clarified where **software alone is insufficient without aligned incentives, readiness, and adoption**.

## What This Case Says About How I Lead

This case reflects how I approach product leadership:

- I remain calm and decisive in high-stakes environments
- I prioritize trust and reliability when consequences are real
- I design products around human constraints, not ideal users
- I adapt strategy honestly as markets shift
- I value accountability over optics, especially in crisis situations
