# CollegeSnapps: A mobile application to help get students to and through college

CollegeSnapps gets students to and through college.
Don Frazer and Matt Drake were both educators who had a dream to help underprivileged students get into college. They had noticed a huge problem which could be easily solved. As students work their way through high school they were not aware of deadlines that could critically affect their chance of getting a higher education.  For example, if they forget to sign up for the ACT by a certain date then this could cascade into missing college submission deadlines, which could then have them missing the first year of college. For some of these students, they would be the first in their family to ever go to college. If they missed that first deadline then it was very unlikely that they would ever go at all.

CollegeSnapps communicate in a way that the students could relate to. It looked like a chat app but it connected the students to an automated script of tasks they needed to be successful. If the student ran into a problem, a real counselor would be able to step in and help get the student back on track.

What did Matt do?
Matt Paulin helped to capture the need for this solution and to produce it into a mobile application. When Don Fraser and Matt Drake first approached Matt Paulin, they had the problem well understood. But they did not know how to work with the technology to form the idea.

Matt worked from the beginning with Don and Matt Drake helping to understand the problem that they had illustrated and then to work with his team to quickly design a mobile application that would solve this problem. This involved user research with students and many attempts to find a superior way to communicate with each student. The results from the exercises was an application that was a progress tracker that had scripted sets of tasks for communicating with a counselor.

Next Matt had to address the counselorâ€™s problems. These counselors had to manage hundreds of students. CollegeSnapps could solve this by making it easier to track and automate many of the flows for the different students. The counselors would log in through a website and build scripts that all of the students could follow.

Matt Paulin created a team of engineers and a product designer to build this vision. He worked closely to turn the vision of CollegeSnapps into a product that could be used with students. The resulting application looked simple but had many features all designed to keep students on track for college. For example, there was a way to reach out to the counselor if the student was lost in the process and needed to schedule a time to talk about it.

CollegeSnapps goes to SXSWedu
With the application completed, the CollegeSnapps team had the privilege of presenting the application to educators at SXSWEdu. We were a unique blend of technology and educators and made it into the finalist round next to much better funded startups.

What made our application stand out was that the product was designed for simplicity and to meet students in a way that they naturally communicate. Coupling this with the passion and real world problems that Don Fraser and Matt Drake brought we were able to attract attention from many education groups and philanthropists in the audience.
