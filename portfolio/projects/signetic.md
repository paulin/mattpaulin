# Context: Signetic MVS created and ready just before the 2021 vaccination efforts
In November 2020 it was announced that a vaccine was created to battle Covid. Immediately a market was kicked off for vaccinating the entire U.S. population. Signetic MVS was formed from flu vaccination software. Signetic MVS was built on top of the Power Apps Platform from Microsoft with a modern product team in Nepal.


# Action: Marketing and growing a product in an extremely fluid markets
Once the MVP product was created in December of 2020 we immediately went about marketing and communicating through press releases and interested parties began reaching out to find a way to manage the vaccination process. We were immediately talking with the City of Seattle, groups in Arizona, and the Bahama government. In January of 2021, Signetic became the preferred partner to grow Signetic MVS into exactly what the City of Seattle needed.

My role was to work with the CPO, Lukas Svec, to focus the development efforts on what was immediately needed. I provided engineering advice, usability studies, and product definitions and help to tie all of the teams together. Part of this role was to establish the correct processes and focus the efforts of the development. Our development sprints were 2-3 days long giving us the ability to rapidly create features and adjust to the ever changing requirements of Covid vaccinations. For example, we had to change the eligibility requirements every week as new groups opened up. Other consistent problems were the reporting of vaccination usage to the Department of Health and the unpredictable supply of vaccines.

I worked side by side with the development team and was responsible for the major features that were discovered from the customer success team and marketing team. For example this also led to the creation of one of the most important features, the ability to associate the vaccine appointments with a unique one time code. Thanks to this feature, Signetic clients were able to focus their efforts on underserved populations and reserve vaccines for those who typically get drowned out by better connected populations.

# Marketing in a volatile market
In parallel Matt led a marketing team that was responsible for business analysis, branding, messaging, sales assets, swag, press reports, digital marketing, and social media. Information from this research was used to establish user stories and communicate what customers needed to manage their mass vaccinations at scale.  From these efforts 7 fire departments and Federally Qualified Health Center were added to the client base.


When the number of clients grew too great for the founders to interact with, I formed a Customer Success team. This teamâ€™s mission was to onboard and listen to the customers. We wanted every customer to be trained so that they would feel no frustration from the product. Every moment counted and we needed the clients to feel empowered to use the software and communicate with their patients about changing dates, locations, and eligibility.

# Results: Seattle becomes the second U. S. City to reach a vaccinated tipping point

It was an absolute team effort, thanks to the City of Seattle, Seattle Fire Department, and the surrounding Fire Department the greater team successfully vaccinated 500,000 people, most in Seattle and the surrounding area. This made Seattle the second most vaccinated city in the United States. The results were immediate. The covid rates dropped dramatically allowing the City to reopen with confidence.

Additionally our team was the most equitable in the nation. Thanks to the features and rapid rollout of the software we were able to conclusively show that we had gotten the vaccines to the people who needed it the most in the right order.
