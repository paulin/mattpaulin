## Core Bio / Introduction

**Full Version:**
I'm Matt Paulin — a product leader, technologist, and entrepreneur who builds systems, ships software, and explores how emerging technology turns into real product capability.

For the past 20 years, I've founded companies, launched products, and delivered software that people actually use. I believe all great technology comes down to one thing: **communication.** Whether it's a product interface, a system that connects people, or software that lets humans and machines work together, I focus on building tools that help people learn, decide, and move forward together.

**Short Version:**
I'm Matt Paulin — a product leader and technologist with 20 years of experience building and shipping software products.

## What I Do

I wear three hats that work together:

- **Entrepreneur** – I create companies and communities that bring ideas to life.
- **AI-Driven Product Leader** – I explore how machine learning, data, and autonomy translate into real product capabilities, tradeoffs, and decisions.
- **Product Builder** – I deliver software from concept to launch, always focused on the end user and real-world constraints.

I use hands-on projects and experiments to stay close to emerging capabilities and sharpen product judgment.

What excites me most is seeing people use what I've built — because that's when ideas become impact.

## How I Work

I approach product development like climbing a mountain where you don't have a map. As a team, we explore, adapt, and learn as we go — using evidence and judgment to decide the next step.

- I believe in shipping early and learning fast.
- I trust teams and empower them with clarity instead of bloated requirements.
- I focus on systems, incentives, and decision-making, not just features.

OKRs have been part of my toolkit at every company I've led — not as busywork, but as guardrails for strategy, focus, and accountability.

## What I'm Exploring Now

We're living in a new era of product development, powered by AI. As complexity is abstracted away, the most important question is no longer *how* to build, but *what should we build, and why?*

I'm exploring:

- **AI-Driven Products** – experimenting with how machine learning and data systems meaningfully change product capability.
- **Autonomy & Learning** – hands-on exploration of reinforcement learning and autonomous systems.
- **Games & Play** – using games as tools for education, creativity, and learning through experience.

At the heart of it all is one goal: creating products that give people **epiphanies** — new ways to learn, communicate, and grow.

## Collaborations & Community

I love working with people who bring design sense, boldness, and intellectual honesty. I balance that with my strengths: catalyzing teams, building systems into existence, and organizing ideas into communities.

If you're building software products, leading teams, or exploring how AI is reshaping product work, I'd love to connect.
