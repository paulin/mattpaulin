## Core Bio / Introduction

**Full Version:**
I'm Matt Paulin — a technologist and entrepreneur who builds products, writes software, and digs into data.

For the past 20 years, I've founded companies, launched products, and delivered software that people actually use. I believe all great technology comes down to one thing: **communication.** Whether it's a product interface, a system that connects people, or code that lets us talk to machines, I build tools that help people work, learn, and achieve more together.

**Short Version:**
I'm Matt Paulin, I have created companies, developed software, and launched products for 20 years.

## What I Do

I wear three hats that work together:

- **Entrepreneur** – I create companies and communities that bring ideas to life.
- **Data Scientist** – I use data and AI to uncover insights and build smarter products.
- **Product Builder** – I deliver software from concept to launch, always focused on the end user.

What excites me most is seeing people use what I've built — because that's when ideas become impact.

## How I Work

I approach product development like climbing a mountain: where you don't have a map. As a team we explore, adapt, and keep moving upward. Along the way, you learn who your users are, why they matter, and how to deliver real value.

- I believe in shipping fast and showing progress every week.
- I trust teams and empower them with clarity instead of bloated requirements.
- I build communities and teams on honesty, compassion, and consistency.

OKRs have been part of my toolkit at every company I've led — not as busywork, but as guardrails for strategy, focus, and accountability.

## What I'm Exploring Now

We're living in a new era of product development, powered by AI. With complexity abstracted away, the big question is no longer *how* to build, but *what should we build?*

I'm exploring:

- **AI & Data Science** – shaping products that adapt and think alongside us.
- **Autonomy & Learning** – experimenting with reinforcement learning and autonomous systems.
- **Games & Play** – using games as tools for education, creativity, and lifelong learning.

At the heart of it all is one goal: creating products that give people **epiphanies** — new ways to learn, communicate, and grow.

## Collaborations & Community

I love working with people who bring design sense, boldness, and the ability to project ideas unapologetically. I balance that with my strengths: catalyzing teams, building systems into existence, and organizing ideas into communities.

If you're building software products, working with OKRs, or exploring the frontiers of AI, I'd love to connect.
