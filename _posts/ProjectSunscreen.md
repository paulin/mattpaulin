# A bad idea
So I have been thinking about what it would take to cool the Earth. Most of the ideas on this subject involved reducing Carbon. I totally agree with this and I think we have to be responsible for what we put in the atmosphere.  But I think we are going to have a really hard time changing the temperature this way. Essentially, we have to get all 7 billion of us to agree. That seems like the real problem. So while we are working on this, how about a plan B.

Plan B: What if we put a sun shield between the earth and the sun to reduce the amount of energy getting to the earth?

BONUS: If we can control dimming the light then we can turn it up if it gets too cold.

So I will admit I don't think this will work because we simply do not know how to do this. It is a bit of a pie in the sky idea, almost literally, however I still want to explore what this would take.


# How much energy do we need to change?
Lets start with how much energy the Earth is even absorbing.  Since it is essentially a circular shape being illuminated we can make a gross approximation by just taking it's surface area and mutiplying by the solar constant.

* Radius of Earth = 6,378 km
* Visible Earth area = 6378 ^ 2 X pi = 127796483130631 square meters
* Solar Constant: 1.361 kilowatts per square meter (kW/m2) [Energy numbers from NASA](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/EnergyBalance/page2.php)

 Visible Earth Area X 1.361 = 1.739310135407893e+17 kW

# How much energy should we block?

1. [Earth has changed 1 degree Celcius from where it should be](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/) So I would assume it is the same amount to reduce to go down one degree Celcius.

2. It takes [533,000,000 kJ](https://www.quora.com/Has-anyone-calculated-how-much-energy-is-required-to-raise-the-temperature-of-Earth-our-planet-by-one-degree) to warm the Earth 1 degree Celcius.

So essentially we need to know how many square meters we need to block to reduce 533 Million kilojoules.

Let's start by figuring out how many watts that needs to be for one day.
46051200000000 = 533000000 * 24 * 60 * 60

1. [Earth absorbs](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/EnergyBalance) absorbs an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter (one watt is one joule of energy every second).

If we make a proportion of how much the earth absorbs from the solar constant we find out that the earth only absorbs
earthEnergy = totalEnergy * absorbEarth/solarConstant
* blockArea = earthVisibleArea * wattChange/earthEnergy
The answer I get is 1,918,800,000,000 square meters or about 1,918,800 sq km which is roughly the size of the state of Washington.

# Does this make sense?

Temperature of Space = [-270.42 Celsius](https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/universe/what-is-the-temperature-of-space.html)
Average temp on Earth = [13.9 degrees Celsius](https://www.space.com/17816-earth-temperature.html)



# How would you do this?

1. We need to put it at [Lagrange point 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point)

L1 point
The L1 point lies on the line defined between the two large masses M1 and M2. It is the point where the gravitational attraction of M2 and that of M1 combine to produce an equilibrium. An object that orbits the Sun more closely than Earth would normally have a shorter orbital period than Earth, but that ignores the effect of Earth's own gravitational pull. If the object is directly between Earth and the Sun, then Earth's gravity counteracts some of the Sun's pull on the object, and therefore increases the orbital period of the object. The closer to Earth the object is, the greater this effect is. At the L1 point, the orbital period of the object becomes exactly equal to Earth's orbital period. L1 is about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, or 0.01 au.

2. Use small craft that can collect electricity and hold it's position.

3. Produce them and place them at a reduced costs.

4. I wonder if you can get enough material from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis, only 370m in diameter

# So how could this even work?

As it turns out astroids are constantly coming near us. In fact on 2029-04-13	[Apophis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis) should be about 38.0170 thousand km) give or take	Â±3.4 km. What if we could capture it and use it's material to build some sort of sunscreen. NOTE: The moon is [363,300 km](https://www.space.com/18145-how-far-is-the-moon.html) away so this is pretty close if we ever just wanted a bunch of rocks.  It's about the size of a giant building and is composed of sand, iron, and nickel. Here is an exerpt from [Nasa](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/apophis/in-depth/).

"Apophis is classified as an S-type, or stony-type asteroid made up of silicate (or rocky) materials and a mixture of metallic nickel and iron. Radar images suggest it is elongated and possibly has two lobes, making it look something like a peanut. Much more will be learned about this asteroid's structure following its close flyby of Earth in 2029."


Obviously the first problem is capture and moving it to L1. We have 6 years to figure that part out. It is nice that it shows up about every 7 years. So maybe we could put an engine on it when it passes by next time and then use that to alter it's orbit.

# What can you do with Nickel, Iron, and Silicon?
I'm not sure but this is where I will leave this thought experiment. The general idea is that we block sunlight from getting to the Earth, maybe by building big umberella ships, maybe by grinding up an astroid and spraying it all over L1.
