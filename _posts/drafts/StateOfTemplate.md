## Concept:

Planning team met to discuss an overall topic

We have three final ideas and will choose one on Friday

A brief is due to the Content team the following Thursday

## Content:

The Content team is ready to start writing copy as soon as our idea is finalized

They are gathering pertinent company information that should be included

## Design:

Design reviewed five ebook examples to determine the style they liked

They will be choosing a template by next Tuesday

## Additional notes or highlights:

Jen is out of the office all next week so please direct any content questions to Joy

Thank you to Henry for curating a huge list of topics for us to choose from!

## Issues/challenges:

The e-book’s deadline is tight, as we all know. It’s critical that we’re all working in our project management tool to keep everyone organized and on track. Thanks!
