# Generative AI
For the last month I took a break from working on Machine Vision and instead decided I wanted to learn more about Generative AI. I found this fantastic course from [Curious Refuse](curiousrefuge.com) who took the time to figure out the best tools for Generative Storytelling.  If you have seen these [Fake LOTR Trailers](https://youtu.be/KrjL_TSOFrI) then you should know it is the same people.  At any case they took the time to explain how it was all done and I highly recommend their course. Here are my take-aways.

# Deepfakes are really hard to do well.
I tried creating characters and then face swapping them. After that you can use tools to make them talk. This never looks right. I tried it for one friend using 11labs text to voice and it didn't work at all. It couldn't catch his unique style of talking. He ended up looking wooden and very strange.

I feel like the technology is a long way off from being able to take a voice print and learn how an actor is going to move. I think what is more likely is that they will be able to create filler shots easily instead of having to reshoot them all the time. That will likely lower the cost of creating and producing the films.

# MidJourney and ChatGPT make you a creative superhero
I don't think that Generative AI will replace creative people anytime soon. I love MidJourney for ideas but at a certain point I had to just pull it into photoshop to customize it. It can only take it so far. I do think that is is a fantastic tool for creating the "feeling" that you are looking for.

OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 is another amazing tool. In just 30 minutes you can come up with a concept, shot list, scenes, and a script in 30 minutes. The problem is that it is only somewhat clever. It doesn't come up with very complicated dialog and ultimately it doesn't know what to speak to or what it can weave in as a deeper meaning. What it is great at is getting over a blank page. It will generate a scaffold for you to get something together. Then it is about endlessly changing that base layer to turn it into what you want.

In a way both of these tools are similar. They give you a starting place but they do not give you an answer. This is why I agree with the team at Curious Refuse where they think that the art will come down to the selection. I think it is more than that really. It isn't just about selecting the right scene and script. It is about figuring out how to combine these elements to turn it into the vision you wanted. I would say that these tools become your sidekicks and copilots that help you get you story told. For that reason I don't think it will ever really replace a real editor. Instead I think it will be making stories better by giving the creators extra energy to get over their hurdles and writer block.

# I learned to appreciate film craft more
After trying to be a writer, producer, and editor; I have become much more appreciative of their craft. I now started noticing the shots, the art, and the billions of details put into a film.

# I think the ultimate goal would be a puppet show.
Essentially you would get the voice prints and looks of your actors. You would assign them to character. Then you could position them and have them do their lines. At the same time you would move the cameras to different angles to capture the store. The end result would be creating a movie really cheap.
