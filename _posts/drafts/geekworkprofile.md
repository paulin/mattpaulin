Below is a little more information about the GeekWork profile I mentioned.

We have settled on a format - at least the first iteration - I am not sure if you remember the Dewar's Profile ads but they actually inspired a pretty popular format for profiles. Here is a link.


We are instead going to do the GeekWire Builders Profile. It will not be an ad or photoshoot but will be a few quick but important questions and answers, and a photo or two if you would like. We will keep it professional (I won't ask anyone about their favorite beverage). I think you would be a great person to feature.  If you might like to be featured, can you answer the questions below or perhaps a selection of a few that are most relevant to you?

#What do I want this profile to be for?
It should be for finding a job. I should build a character of myself that can be a strong candidate for product development leadership. My current role is as a product consultant

#What is your profession or craft?
*Hmmm, do I want to look like a product guy? Or a consultant?*
I build digital products and consult with teams. I both love the adventure of going deep into a technology as well helping other professionals succeed by getting them to think differently. If I could I would split my time equally between creating products as well as working with others doing the same.

I have built three companies and absolutely love the challenge of navigating the complex business and technology landscapes that provide the backdrop for our world. I have also worked within large companies and startups. I have a fairly broad set of experiences that I use to help translate between different groups in an organization. Typically I use an OKR process to help provide structure to everything.

My favorite challenges are right on the edge of what is possible. Originally I was a software engineer when the dotcom bubble collapsed. When the Android and iPhone market places came online I built a company to enable clients with mobile first software development. We helped create applications for Cheezeburger Networks, Zulily, Rover, OfferUp, Holland America, and many more. I'm focused on finding new products enabled by data science and machine learning. In particular the world of machine vision and neural networks is a wide open space. I feel like the next generations will need to understand how to train self learning software. To help with that I am working on building a self driving RC car with my son called Carbot.


#Why do you do what you do, or why do you love what you do?
Growing up I invented things. For example I tried to organize a rocket club in the 6th grade. Later in high school I tried to recreate the Pons Fleischmann cold fusion experiments. I love the act of creation and innovation with other people. The bonding moment of having a group of people focus on a common goal and support each other is a very special and rare moment.

The time we live in is amazing, scary, and rich. I have had the fortune of being a programmer during the dotcom boom and bust. I have also built businesses during the housing crisis and and products during the launch of the mobile app stores. During the pandemic I worked on an online education business and ended up being part of the vaccination of Seattle.

It is always chaos, and there are always opportunities in disquise. Being in technology am fortunate enough to be bombarded with amazing tools that give us super powers we have never had before. Check out google cloud, terraform, Jupyter Notebook, and Tensor Flow if you want just some ideas. This is the time for inventing, it just isn't in a garage.



#Book most impactful to your career or book most recently read?
"Speed and Scale" by John Doerr is a must read. This book will provide you with what you need to know about climate change and how you can help. Additionally it is a lesson in how to apply OKRs toward self governance which I believe might be an innovation politics has been missing.

I don't think we have enough people worrying about these problems and John Doerr has created the dashboard to keep track of where we are in correcting our climate.


#Hobby or what do you love to do outside of work?
I probably have too many hobbies; but I will be sailing in the Duck Dodge throughout the summer. I also rock climb and practice karate. My family raises handicap assistance dogs and we experiment with gardening. The common thread here is community. I like activities that promote community and typically my kids are involved in the same activities I am doing.


#Highest or most recent achievement? Or, most daring career move?
Durning the pandemic I was part of the team that distributed 500k vaccines in Seattle at Lumen Field and through the Fire Departments. It was a great opportunity to pitch in and help Seattle get back on it's feet. It was also one of the most interesting products I had worked on. I remember distinctly that on April 14, 2021 we went from having a massive amount of demand to suddenly having too much supply. Software features we were working on immediately became useless and we had to pivot to new features. I'm so grateful for agile methodologies that allowed us to hold onto this wild ride as we kept finding new ways to make sure the vaccines were available for groups that needed them.

#3 - 5 words that describe you, and/or a short statement that describes you or your life/work philosophy.
Mada mada desu, It's a Japanese saying for "A long long way to go", and can be a response to a compliment. It is also a common saying in our household and means there is always more room to improve.

Not dead yet. You don’t know how much time you have in front of you, but that is the time that matters the most. Use some of it occasionally to ask yourself if you are using the rest of it the best for you.
If you could be known for one quote, what would it be?

I love this quote from Ward Cunningham, founder of wiki’s, “What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?”. I find that it breaks down the mental stalemates that my friends and I tend to put ourselves into when we are starting out on a project.

#Finally, Why Seattle? Why do you choose to live and work in our region? (I'd like everyone to answer this one)
I grew up in Kansas. For my family to get to Colorado and play in the mountains it took 14 hours of driving. My parents would award the first kid to spot the Rocky Mountains with a quarter. On these drives we would also play games like, “guess how long it will take to get to that barn?”, OR “who can find the most state license plates?”. We had one trip to CA when I was in 6th grade and that was one of the first times to see the ocean. Kansas was great, lots of space to try stuff out, aircraft industry, and really good people. But I love nature, and back in April I went to the beach on Saturday and snowboarding on Sunday. That is just awesome. You really can't beat the nature, opporitunity, and mixing of cultures that is Seattle.
