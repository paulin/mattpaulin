## Idea Sparks: Inventions from my mind

This is another batch of idea sparks I give to you. I hope they find a way to amuse you or inspire you.  

---

### Kasa Blinds  
**The Spark:** I want my blinds to open and close like the lights do — on a timer, through my Kasa app.  
**The Pitch:** A smart blind controller that connects to the Kasa ecosystem. Set schedules, trigger open/close events alongside your lights or thermostat.  
**Why It Matters:** Your smart home shouldn't stop at the window.

---

### Chatbot Team  
**The Spark:** Each chatbot is powerful, but none of them coordinate.  
**The Pitch:** A Slack-based workspace where your personal GPT-powered PM delegates tasks to different specialized bots: GPT-4 for writing, Bard for search, Midjourney for visuals. You define a goal metric, and the bot team reports in.  
**Why It Matters:** Imagine AI tools collaborating like a real team — not just one assistant, but a whole department.

---

### Uncontrollable Calendar  
**The Spark:** What if your calendar told you what to do… for fun?  
**The Pitch:** A calendar your friends can write into, not for real appointments, but for surprise adventures. “Flight to New Zealand at 2pm.” “Movie marathon starts now.” It’s a game.  
**Why It Matters:** Reintroduce spontaneity and absurdity into adult life.

---

### Job Req Coupon Code  
**The Spark:** Referrals feel casual. What if they felt official?  
**The Pitch:** HR software that generates one-time use referral codes employees can give to friends. Applicants enter the code when applying, linking them to their referrer with full traceability.  
**Why It Matters:** Makes referrals clearer, fairer, and more trackable.

---

### Laptop Banner  
**The Spark:** Working in shared spaces is hard to signal.  
**The Pitch:** A small display that clips to the top of your laptop, facing outward. Show a message like “On Break: Ask me about snowboarding” or “Do Not Disturb: Deep Work.”  
**Why It Matters:** A non-verbal, respectful way to shape your environment in shared workspaces.

---

### Chatbot Interviewer  
**The Spark:** Interviewing is awkward — for everyone.  
**The Pitch:** A bot conducts your first round interview. You might not even know it's a bot. It evaluates your responses, offers follow-up questions, and flags moments for the human team to review.  
**Why It Matters:** Efficient, scalable, and maybe a little eerie. But it's already arriving.

---

### Address Compass  
**The Spark:** You care about places — but maps are too abstract.  
**The Pitch:** An app that acts like a compass for your personal places. Enter multiple addresses (mom’s house, your cabin, your old school) and it displays arrows pointing in their direction and distance.  
**Why It Matters:** Emotional orientation. More meaningful than a pin on a screen.

---

### Spoiler Tags  
**The Spark:** Not everything should be read immediately.  
**The Pitch:** A new HTML tag: `<spoiler>` hides content until hovered or tapped. It’s built for sensitive content, spoilers, punchlines, or optional info.  
**Why It Matters:** Web content gets more interactive, respectful of context.

---

### Replicator POC  
**The Spark:** What if Amazon felt like magic?  
**The Pitch:** A built-in cabinet in your house, with a touch screen on the inside. From your perspective, you “request” an item and it slowly appears — the delivery happens through a door on the outside.  
**Why It Matters:** A blend of sci-fi illusion and real-world convenience.

---

### Tree Tourniquet  
**The Spark:** Trees grow. Sometimes too much.  
**The Pitch:** A controlled-growth tourniquet you wrap around a young tree. It gently constrains expansion in certain directions (e.g. near a fence, foundation, or wires).  
**Why It Matters:** Precision urban landscaping. Manage growth, don’t just trim it after the fact.

## What You Can Do:
- **Steal an idea.** Seriously, please build one and let me know how it turns out.
- **Improve one.** Tell me how it could be better.

This isn’t a pitch deck. It’s a conversation starter.

Thanks for reading. Go and invent weird, useful, joyful things.
