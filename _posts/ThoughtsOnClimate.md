# A bad idea
What if we put a sun shield between the earth and the sun to reduce the amount of energy getting to the earth?

What if we could turn it to open up more light, or close it to reduce the amount of light?

# Its a feature not a bug
Since we already have cast a blanket of CO2 around the earth, we can use it as a regulator. If we want more heat, we let in more energy.

# Why this?
Because we will fail to reduce carbon enough.

But step back, a moment, and look at what the problem is? It's an energy problem.

# How much energy do we need to change?
Radius of Earth = 6,378 km
[Energy numbers from NASA](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/EnergyBalance/page2.php)
Solar Constant: Earthâ€™s average distance from the Sun (about 150 million kilometers), the average intensity of solar energy reaching the top of the atmosphere directly facing the Sun is about 1,360 watts per square meter.

[Solar Constant:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_constant) It is measured by satellite as being 1.361 kilowatts per square meter (kW/m2)

[Earth absorbs](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/EnergyBalance) absorbs an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter (one watt is one joule of energy every second).

[Earth has changed 1 degree Celcius from where it should be](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/)

It takes [533,000,000 kJ](https://www.quora.com/Has-anyone-calculated-how-much-energy-is-required-to-raise-the-temperature-of-Earth-our-planet-by-one-degree) to warm the Earth 1 degree Celcius.
So I would assume it is the same amount to reduce to go down one degree Celcius.

Temperature of Space = [-270.42 Celsius](https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/universe/what-is-the-temperature-of-space.html)
Average temp on Earth = [13.9 degrees Celsius](https://www.space.com/17816-earth-temperature.html)




# How would you do this?

1. We need to put it at [Lagrange point 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point)

L1 point
The L1 point lies on the line defined between the two large masses M1 and M2. It is the point where the gravitational attraction of M2 and that of M1 combine to produce an equilibrium. An object that orbits the Sun more closely than Earth would normally have a shorter orbital period than Earth, but that ignores the effect of Earth's own gravitational pull. If the object is directly between Earth and the Sun, then Earth's gravity counteracts some of the Sun's pull on the object, and therefore increases the orbital period of the object. The closer to Earth the object is, the greater this effect is. At the L1 point, the orbital period of the object becomes exactly equal to Earth's orbital period. L1 is about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, or 0.01 au.

2. Use small craft that can collect electricity and hold it's position.

3. Produce them and place them at a reduced costs.

4. I wonder if you can get enough material from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis, only 370m in diameter

Hey @race , just curious but do you know of any space propulsion that used a magnetic field to interact with the magnetic field of a planet or the sun?  For instance, just a big loop of wire that when powered creates a field that then pushes or pulls on the fields from other bodies near it.

It's probably an old idea, but I can't figure out what it would have been called.

Sure.  My advisor in grad school invented a plasma sail project called mini magnetospheric plasma propulsion or M2P2.  Creates an artificial magnetoaphere that is pushed by the solar wind particles.  For just hanging out over a planet there's an old concept called the pole sitter, where a craft would generate their own magnetic field to repel the field of a planet that has one and use it to just sit above the pole of the planet without orbiting.  It always felt to me that it would require too much energy to be worth it compared to just an orbit with a high apogee.

Hmm, if you have to hold a craft at L1 for as long as possible, what propulsion system would your recommend?  The helictical ion engine you designed? Or is there something pretty common?
