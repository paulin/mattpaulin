### 10/16/2024 — State Control Vasectomy (SCV)  
**The Spark:** Conversations about bodily autonomy often get stuck in political silos.  
**The Pitch:** A fictional organization advocating for state control over vasectomies — a satirical straw man designed to provoke conversation and highlight hypocrisy. The deeper intent is to create common ground between Second Amendment supporters and pro-choice advocates.  
**Why It Matters:** A thought experiment and conversation starter that invites new coalitions around personal rights.

### 10/17/2024 — Jira Standup Module  
**The Spark:** Daily standups get stale, especially when the order is always the same.  
**The Pitch:** A Jira plugin or Zoom integration that shuffles team members by playful or contextual criteria — shirt color, background image, last commit, or bug count.  
**Why It Matters:** Keeps meetings fresh, adds a dash of randomness, and increases team attention.

### 10/18/2024 — Liquid Title  
**The Spark:** Your job title rarely reflects what you're actually doing.  
**The Pitch:** An AI that analyzes your tasks, calendar, and Slack messages, then dynamically updates your job title. “Bug Wrangler,” “Slide Deck Surgeon,” or “Crisis Containment Officer.”  
**Why It Matters:** Brings humor and insight into the way we work — and how we’re perceived.

### 10/19/2024 — Success Meter, Normalizee  
**The Spark:** Achievement isn’t always apples to apples.  
**The Pitch:** A reflective tool where you input your accomplishments and your starting circumstances. It adjusts for privilege, access, and adversity — then offers a normalized success score.  
**Why It Matters:** Promotes empathy, self-compassion, and a broader view of what success means.

### 10/19/2024 — Home Dimsum Bot  
**The Spark:** Automated food prep is mostly burgers and pizza — why not dumplings?  
**The Pitch:** Repurpose Amazon-style warehouse robots for home use. They steam, roll, and plate dim sum. Small, fast, and focused on one job: delicious dumplings.  
**Why It Matters:** Home automation meets culinary joy.

### 10/20/2024 — The Nuclear Option  
**The Spark:** A name that hit like a hot sauce.  
**The Pitch:** It’s just a name. “The Nuclear Option.” For hot sauce, for tech shutdowns, for extreme decisions.  
**Why It Matters:** Sometimes an idea is just a label — but the label is sticky.

---

### 10/20/2024 — AI Will  
**The Spark:** Death is complicated. Executors are human.  
**The Pitch:** An AI trained on your values, preferences, and legal wishes that acts as your digital executor — handling asset transfers, communication, and document management when you pass.  
**Why It Matters:** Could make estate planning more accessible, less emotional, and more thorough.

### 10/21/2024 — Datadog for Email  
**The Spark:** Email clutter follows patterns — but they’re hard to see.  
**The Pitch:** An analytics dashboard (like Datadog) for your inbox. Visualize frequency, timing, and source of incoming messages. Spot patterns like “every 2 weeks from GoDaddy.”  
**Why It Matters:** Helps reduce noise, improve filters, and regain control over your inbox.

---

### 10/23/2024 — Bow Biter for Hospital Gowns  
**The Spark:** Why are hospital gowns still open in the back?  
**The Pitch:** A simple add-on — like a clip, belt, or cumberbund — to close the back of a gown. Comfort, dignity, and modesty in one.  
**Why It Matters:** Small fix, big difference in patient experience.

### 10/25/2024 — Dishwasher Case for Retainers  
**The Spark:** Retainers are gross. Cleaning them is worse.  
**The Pitch:** A protective, dishwasher-safe case that holds retainers securely during a wash cycle. Keeps them from falling through the racks or melting.  
**Why It Matters:** Makes dental hygiene easier and less annoying, especially for kids (and tired parents).
