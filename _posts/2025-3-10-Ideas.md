### 1/6/2025 — AI for Permissions  
**The Spark:** Most IT requests boil down to “I don’t have access.”  
**The Pitch:** A bot that detects permission errors and either fixes them automatically or guides you through the request flow. Think of it as an AI helpdesk for managing roles and access.  
**Why It Matters:** Reduces friction, support tickets, and IT bottlenecks in growing teams.

### 1/29/2025 — Everybody Votes IRL  
**The Spark:** How can a group think together without fear or tracking?  
**The Pitch:** An in-person event where attendees get a yes/no controller. A moderator poses questions, and live results are displayed. To preserve privacy and honesty, people randomly swap controllers before each vote.  
**Why It Matters:** Encourages open expression without surveillance anxiety — and adds a data science layer to social dynamics.

### 2/16/2025 — Grocery Bag Seat Belt  
**The Spark:** Groceries sliding around your trunk like hockey pucks.  
**The Pitch:** A retractable or clip-on strap designed to secure grocery bags in your trunk. Think seatbelt, but for eggs and produce.  
**Why It Matters:** Reduces waste, mess, and mystery bruises on your fruit.

### 2/18/2025 — Whippy Man Dog Saddle  
**The Spark:** Just a funny visual.  
**The Pitch:** A novelty dog saddle featuring a miniature cowboy figure that flops around as your dog walks or runs.  
**Why It Matters:** Pure joy. Conversation starter. Viral dog park content.

### 2/22/2025 — Live Action Cooking Show  
**The Spark:** Watching a cooking show is great, but what if you got to eat?  
**The Pitch:** A hybrid performance experience: you sit in an audience while a chef prepares dishes on stage — and serves you samples throughout.  
**Why It Matters:** Sensory storytelling. Turns food media into a full-bodied, in-person experience.

---

### 2/22/2025 — Tech Heist Movie  
**The Spark:** What if tech workers broke bad?  
**The Pitch:** A story about four laid-off tech workers now working retail who pull off a sophisticated heist using their old skills. Think *Ocean’s Eleven* meets *Office Space*.  
**Why It Matters:** Resonates with the times, and everyone loves a heist.

### 2/25/2025 — Tiny Microwave  
**The Spark:** Your coffee is cold and the kitchen is too far.  
**The Pitch:** A microwave just big enough to fit a single mug — compact, efficient, and designed to sit on your desk.  
**Why It Matters:** Saves time, keeps drinks hot, and fits in modern workspaces.

---

### 2/25/2025 — Violet Grocery Store  
**The Spark:** Every aisle at the store has a deep backstory.  
**The Pitch:** A documentary series exploring the origins and histories of spices, meats, vegetables, and other common grocery items. Named “Violet” to feel nostalgic and cinematic.  
**Why It Matters:** Makes the mundane fascinating and connects everyday choices to global stories.

---

### 2/27/2025 — Pre-Pixs for Vacation  
**The Spark:** Travel photography is stressful and often inauthentic.  
**The Pitch:** Upload your face, pick your destination, and generate vacation photos of yourself before you even go. Share them, relax on the trip, and leave the selfie stick at home.  
**Why It Matters:** Frees people to enjoy the moment instead of chasing the perfect shot.

### 3/10/2025 — Subscription Traveller  
**The Spark:** You want new scenery, but you’re staying home.  
**The Pitch:** Subscribe to someone else’s photo stream — ideally a world traveler — and pipe their experiences into your digital photo frame.  
**Why It Matters:** Passive adventure. Travel-by-proxy for those who can’t (or don’t want to) go.
