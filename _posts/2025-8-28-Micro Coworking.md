## Why We‚Äôre Doing This

Many of us work from home, but we‚Äôve realized that something is missing: the energy, focus, and synergy that come from sharing space with motivated people. Instead of joining a big coworking brand, we‚Äôre creating a **shared office just for friends**.  

The goals are simple:  
- A central, dedicated place to **focus**.  
- A community of people who support each other‚Äôs work.  
- A fair and sustainable way to share costs.  

Below you‚Äôll find our **Coworking Charter**‚Äîthe agreement we‚Äôre making to keep things smooth and fun.
