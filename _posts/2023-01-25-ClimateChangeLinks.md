# Climate Change Links
I have spent a week getting up to speed on climate change and what I can do to help. At the same time I have found a lot of really helpful online resources. Below are the best ones that I have run across. I will keep adding to this list as I find some that stand out.

# Plans
[https://speedandscale.com]("Speed and Scale") is the best comprehensive plan. It was put together by John Doerr, the investor and [https://www.whatmatters.com/](author) behind OKRs. He and his team have assembled a set of OKRs for reversing climate change and they also are tracking how we are doing on this tracker.

# ideas
[Project Draw Down](https://www.drawdown.org/) does an excellent job of cataloging ideas around solving climate change. [Wikipedia Summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawdown_(climate))



# Job Resources
["Work on Climate"](https://workonclimate.org/) is a slack channel where you can meet and network with others looking to help with companies fighting climate change. I recommend joining this since it is the best source of fresh jobs I have found.

# Podcast
[How to save a planet, Podcast](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet) is a great way to learn about what is going on in the world. I recommend it since it actually does make me more hopeful.


# Dashboards
[USA Facts Climate Dashboard](https://usafacts.org/issues/climate) is a great source of seeing the actual effects of climate change in the US. In particular I really appreciate their graphics that show how climate has changed from the historic norms.


# Datasets
I'm always on the lookout of new sources of data to add to my data science projects. Here are a couple that I ran across. Please send me more!
