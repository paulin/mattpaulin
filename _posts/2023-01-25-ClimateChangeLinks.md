# Climate Change Links
I have spent a week getting up to speed on climate change and what I can do to help. At the same time I have found a lot of really helpful online resources. Below are the best ones that I have run across. I will keep adding to this list as I find some that stand out.

# Plans
1. [https://speedandscale.com]("Speed and Scale") is the best comprehensive plan. It was put together by John Doerr, the investor and [https://www.whatmatters.com/](author) behind OKRs. He and his team have assembled a set of OKRs for reversing climate change and they also are tracking how we are doing on this tracker. [https://speedandscale.com/tracker/](https://speedandscale.com/tracker/)


2. [Project Draw Down](https://www.drawdown.org/) does an excellent job of cataloging ideas around solving climate change. This [Wikipedia Summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawdown_(climate)) does a pretty good job of summarizing the project.

"Climate drawdown refers to the future point in time when levels of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere stop climbing and start to steadily decline.[1] Drawdown is a milestone in reversing climate change and eventually reducing global average temperatures.[2] Project Drawdown refers to the nonprofit organization with the mission to help the world reach drawdown and stop catastrophic climate change quickly, safely, and equitably. In 2017, a publication titled "Drawdown" became a New York Times bestseller, where it highlighted and described different solutions and efforts available to help reach this goal."


# Dashboards
1. [USA Facts Climate Dashboard](https://usafacts.org/issues/climate) is a great source of seeing the actual effects of climate change in the US. In particular I really appreciate their graphics that show how climate has changed from the historic norms.


# Job Resources
1. ["Work on Climate"](https://workonclimate.org/) is a slack channel where you can meet and network with others looking to help with companies fighting climate change. I recommend joining this since it is the best source of fresh jobs I have found.

2. [https://climatecareerweek.org](https://climatecareerweek.org) is an ongoing job fair to help orient you in the world of Climate Change. Here is a sample from [ClimateCareerWeek Jan 23-27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1-d4gwRYJcA-dMml3xZAdUd8cd_GUx_G)

# Podcast
1. [How to save a planet, Podcast](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet) is a great way to learn about what is going on in the world. I recommend it since it actually does make me more hopeful.

# Datasets
I'm always on the lookout of new sources of data to add to my data science projects. Here are a couple that I ran across. Please send me more!
