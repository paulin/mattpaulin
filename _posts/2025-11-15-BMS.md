# Building a Condo BMS in Two Days Using AI: From Idea Spike to Full Property Management Platform

On November 15, 2025, I completed my sixth idea spike: a rapid-fire exploration where I take an idea and see how quickly I can turn it into a working system using vibe coding and modern AI development tools. This time, the inspiration came from a friend who serves on the board of his condo complex and was dissatisfied with the software available to manage the building. That raised a simple but compelling question.

**How quickly could I build a full property management platform for a condo community—something that actually solves the real problems residents and boards face?**

The answer: about two days.

By combining structured product management, fast user-story iteration, and AI-powered development tools, I built a multi-role Building Management System (BMS) deployed to Google Cloud with real functionality across communication, maintenance, invoicing, budgeting, and more.

What started as a casual discussion became a working prototype of a professional-grade platform. And, interestingly, many of the features I naturally gravitated toward aligned closely with a full research-backed requirements set for modern condo property management software.

This article explains the build, the system, and how it aligns with the core capabilities expected of a mature BMS.

## Why Condo Communities Need Their Own BMS

Condo communities are unique. They operate like small municipalities, managing:

- Finances
- Maintenance of shared assets
- Community communication
- Compliance and governance
- Owners, tenants, and vendors

A BMS (Building Management System) for these communities must unify communication, payments, maintenance operations, and governance into a single, clear interface. It needs to serve everyone—residents, owners, managers, board members—with appropriate permissions and high transparency.

During the idea spike, I built exactly that.

## The System I Built: A Multi-Role Condo Management Platform

The system includes four user types, each with their own dashboard and permissions.

### 1. Administrator Panel

Admins have full visibility and control:

- Registry of all units
- Occupancy and ownership tracking
- Assignment of units to owners or tenants
- Invoice management
- Maintenance request oversight
- Building-wide announcements
- Budgeting and financial tools
- Reporting dashboards

This mirrors the “Resident and Unit Management” and “Financials and Accounting” core capabilities identified in condo-management research.

### 2. Manager View

Managers have a reduced, operations-focused interface:

- Maintenance request processing
- Announcements
- Limited unit and resident management

### 3. Owner Portal

Owners can:

- View owned and occupied units
- Track their maintenance requests
- Receive announcements
- Access key documents

### 4. Resident Portal

Residents have access to:

- Announcements
- Maintenance requests
- Messaging tools

## How the Build Progressed

I followed a familiar product-development loop:

1. Collect user stories
2. Translate them into features
3. Build each feature in sequence
4. Deploy and test
5. Repeat

On the technical side:

- Postgres database
- Docker for local development
- Production deployment to Google Cloud Run
- GitHub Actions generated by Claude Code
- Deployment assisted and monitored by Gemini

- Unit attributes (size, parking, amenities)
- Move-in / move-out history
- Emergency contacts

## 2. Financials, Accounting, and Dues Collection

- HOA dues, assessments, and fees
- Automated invoicing
- Online payments (ACH, cards, e-check)
- Late-fee rules
- Vendor bills and accounts payable
- Budgeting and reserve tracking
- Full audit trails

## 3. Maintenance, Repairs, and Work Orders

- Submit and track maintenance requests
- Assign work orders
- Track costs and attach invoices
- Preventive maintenance scheduling
- Automated notifications

## 4. Governance, Meetings, and Board Processes

- Board and committee roles
- Meeting scheduling and minutes
- Voting and elections
- Violation tracking
- Governing document storage

## 5. Communication and Community Engagement

- Mass announcements
- Message boards
- Event calendars
- Surveys and polls
- Document library

## 6. Access Control, Security, and Building Operations

- Digital access credentials
- Visitor management
- Smart lock integrations

## 7. Reporting and Analytics

- Standard reports
- Custom report builder
- Maintenance backlog dashboards
- Forecasting tools
- Full audit logs

## 8. User, Role, and Permission Management

- Role-based permissions
- Two-factor authentication
- SSO options

## 9. Legal, Compliance, and Insurance

- Insurance policy tracking
- Certificates of insurance
- Compliance checklists
- Violation letters and notices

## 10. Mobile and Field Tools

- Responsive mobile design
- Work-order updates in the field
- Photo uploads
- Push notifications
- Offline mode

## 11. Integrations and Extensibility

- APIs and webhooks
- Accounting exports
- Banking integrations
- E-signatures

## 12. Security, Backup, and Auditability

- Data encryption
- Backups and disaster recovery
- Granular permissions
- Rate limiting

# Conclusion

In just a couple of days, using vibe coding and AI development tools, it was possible to build a working Building Management System for condo communities and deploy it to Google Cloud. What began as an experiment quickly mapped onto a full-fledged blueprint for professional-grade property management software.

With further iteration, this could evolve into a robust system ready for real communities, blending governance, operations, communication, and financial management into a unified, modern experience.
