### 5/19/2024 — Move Slack Comments to the Right Place  
**The Spark:** Slack threads get messy, and nudging people to use them feels passive-aggressive.  
**The Pitch:** A Slack bot or plugin that can automatically move misplaced comments from a channel into the proper thread. You could also drag and organize messages yourself — like cleaning up digital clutter.  
**Why It Matters:** Threaded discussions stay useful. Everyone looks more organized, with less judgment.

### 5/21/2024 — Add Shortener (Podcast Ad Skipper)  
**The Spark:** Every podcast ad is the same. Why not skip them if you know the answers?  
**The Pitch:** When a podcast begins, you take a quick quiz (“What platform lets you rent your house on vacation?”). If you get the answer right, the ad is skipped.  
**Why It Matters:** Rewards listening. Makes repetitive ads less painful. Everyone wins.

### 6/14/2024 — QR Check  
**The Spark:** Writing checks feels outdated, but there’s still no perfect replacement.  
**The Pitch:** Use your bank’s website to enter the recipient and amount, and generate a QR code that functions like a check. Print it on a card or show it on your phone.  
**Why It Matters:** Gives the convenience of digital payments with the flexibility of physical exchange.

### 7/1/2024 — Adopt a Grandchild  
**The Spark:** Intergenerational connection is rare — but needed.  
**The Pitch:** A platform to connect older adults (who may not have children) with younger adults (who may miss grandparents). Think pen pals, Sunday dinners, shared stories.  
**Why It Matters:** Strengthens communities and offers companionship in both directions.

---

### 7/11/2024 — Puzzle Hammer  
**The Spark:** You *know* those pieces fit, the puzzle just disagrees.  
**The Pitch:** A tiny novelty hammer sold with puzzles. A joke, but also a commentary on stubbornness and design flaws.  
**Why It Matters:** A playful reminder to let go — or commit fully.

---

### 10/1/2024 — Personal Emergency Channel  
**The Spark:** Sharing major life events is emotionally exhausting and logistically confusing.  
**The Pitch:** A private, real-name-based social channel (think Twitter for personal emergencies) where you can post updates like surgeries, diagnoses, or big family changes.  
**Why It Matters:** Keeps your people informed without re-telling the story twenty times. Reduces emotional labor in hard times.

---

### 10/2/2024 — Amazon Wishlist for Teachers  
**The Spark:** Teachers need stuff, parents want to help, and no one wants to guess.  
**The Pitch:** A built-in Amazon feature where teachers can create public wishlists by quarter. Parents can browse and contribute any time.  
**Why It Matters:** Teachers get what they need, and parents can support in a low-friction way.

---

### 10/3/2024 — After Meal Tip  
**The Spark:** Sometimes the tip you want to leave comes *after* the service, not before.  
**The Pitch:** A follow-up tip feature via email or app. After your meal or service, you can click a link to leave a new or adjusted tip based on how it went.  
**Why It Matters:** Encourages real-time gratitude, not just habitual tipping.

### 10/4/2024 — Preorder Merch  
**The Spark:** You’re going to a concert. Why not show up in merch made just for that night?  
**The Pitch:** Buy a concert ticket and get early access to exclusive merch. Order it ahead, wear it to the show, and feel like an insider.  
**Why It Matters:** Turns merch into a memory before the event even begins.
