# Big Slice / Small Slice (BSSS)
![BSSS Companion Guide](/assets/images/BSSS_with_levels.png)


## Background and Lineage

The Big Slice / Small Slice idea originated as a **design pattern** for allocating ownership dynamically and transparently in early ventures. It was first described as a way to prevent resentment, hidden dilution, and retroactive negotiation when teams were contributing unevenly under high uncertainty.

The core insight was simple:

- Treat ownership as a fixed whole
- Budget ownership by phase
- Allocate ownership based on contribution

What has changed over time is not the principle, but the **precision**.

This document represents an evolved, opinionated version of that original pattern.

## The Core Idea

A project begins as **100% ownership**.

That ownership is not assigned to people upfront. Instead, it is earned over time as the project progresses through meaningful milestones.

Ownership is divided into:
- **Big Slices** — milestone-level allocations
- **Small Slices** — individual shares earned within a milestone

Progress earns ownership.  
Time alone does not.

---

## Big Slices

A **Big Slice** represents a major milestone in the life of a project.

Each Big Slice:
- Consumes a declared percentage of the total 100%
- Is tied to a specific **Release Level (RL1–RL10)**
- Has a point budget for contribution tracking
- Opens when work begins
- Closes when the Release Level is achieved

**Critical rule:**  
Once a Big Slice is created, its percentage **must never change**.

Point budgets may increase.  
Ownership percentages may not.

---

## Small Slices

Contributors earn **Small Slices** inside a Big Slice.

A Small Slice represents a contributor’s proportional share of that Big Slice, calculated as:

```
(points earned / total points in the Big Slice) × Big Slice percentage
```

When a Big Slice closes, ownership earned inside it is locked.

---

## Why Points, Not Hours

Points are a flexible accounting unit that allow:
- Different types of work to coexist
- Non-time-based contributions to be recognized
- Tradeoffs to be explicit rather than implicit

Hours were a proxy.  
Points are intentional.

## Recommended Ownership Allocation

The following table represents a **recommended allocation** of ownership across Release Levels.

This is not universal law.  
It is an opinionated default that reflects where risk and value tend to concentrate.

| Release Level | Description   | Slice % |
|--------------|---------------|---------|
| RL1 | Idea | 4% |
| RL2 | Vision | 4% |
| RL3 | Prototype | 4% |
| RL4 | Play Test | 12% |
| RL5 | Release | 16% |
| RL6 | Users | 12% |
| RL7 | Audience | 12% |
| RL8 | Monetized | 12% |
| RL9 | Scalable | 12% |
| RL10 | Stable | 12% |
| **Total** | | **100%** |

---

## Allocation Philosophy

- Early stages matter, but are highly speculative
- Mid-stage execution carries the highest product risk
- Late stages reward durability, scale, and operational excellence

Ideas are necessary.  
Execution is decisive.  
Longevity is earned.

---

## What This Is (and Is Not)

This system **is**:
- A contribution accounting model
- A milestone-based ownership framework
- A pre-equity alignment tool

This system **is not**:
- Legal equity
- A cap table
- A shareholder agreement

It is a bridge between ambiguity and formality.

---

## Why This Exists

Most early-stage conflict comes from ambiguity, not bad intent.

BSSS makes three things explicit:
- What matters (Big Slices)
- Who contributed (Small Slices)
- When ownership is earned (Release Levels)

If you never need this system, great.

If you do need it, it will already be there.

---

## Working Notes

- Slice percentages are declared once
- Point budgets may evolve
- Ownership earned is never retroactively adjusted
- Transition to formal equity should reference this ledger, not replace it
