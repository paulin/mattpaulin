# Automate and Elevate

This is my motto for AI: **“Automate and Elevate.”** I believe that from a product perspective, the use of AI should be to remove repetitive tasks from someone's life, giving them focus for a more strategic and thoughtful perspective.

## Defining Statements

- Tasks are small bits of work that we do every day in our life.  
- Jobs are collections of tasks.  
- Workers have jobs that consist of a set of tasks.  
- AI can be used to automate the tasks for the worker.  

Automating a task does not eliminate a job—it allows the worker to accomplish the same amount of work in less time, freeing them up for higher-level tasks. That, to me, is the heart of innovation: reducing the cost of a task until it becomes widely adopted. Spreadsheets are a perfect historical example of this principle.

## How Does AI Apply to Product Development?

This is where the magic is. Product development is a nebulous job involving communication, organization, problem-solving, and vision. It’s about:

- Coordinating between stakeholders and developers  
- Learning from customers and translating that knowledge  
- Prioritizing strategic decisions  
- Navigating legacy decisions  
- Visualizing future states

It's a role that requires adaptability and leadership without authority—“glue work” at its finest. Every product manager role is a little different.

One of our key tools is the **Proof of Concept (POC)**—a fast, scrappy prototype used to align stakeholders. It's full of fake data, not meant to scale, and exists only to spark conversation and define direction.

The faster you can build a POC, the better—and this is where AI shines. I can now:

- Generate concept art  
- Analyze data  
- Brainstorm ideas and names  
- Manage notes  
- Work in parallel

It’s like having an army of assistants that let me focus on **product, direction, and team**—not curating piles of notes that won’t be read.

## The Concierge Strategy… Updated

If you’ve read *The Lean Startup* by Eric Ries, you might remember the **concierge strategy**—a method for manually delivering services before building the tech.

Instead of starting with an app, the entrepreneur behind *Food on the Table* talked to moms and manually helped with meal planning and grocery shopping. This let him understand the user deeply before investing in code.

AI lets me do the same: start manually, understand the need, then automate the tasks and scale. That’s **automate and elevate**.

## The Concierge World

We’re living in a concierge world—scaled up. What if every task in your life were evaluated by skill level, and if low enough, automated?

Examples:

- Doing laundry and dishes  
- Paying bills and taxes  
- Basic home maintenance  

Now scale that thinking to systems—where could we eliminate low-skilled, repetitive work? The challenge is identifying which tasks to automate.

## Conclusion: Acceleration = Automation × Elevation

Want to go faster?

- Identify repetitive tasks  
- Automate them using AI  
- Free yourself (or your users) for higher-level thinking  

It’s scary to go upward—we fear that eventually there will be **nothing left to do**. But I believe we’ll always find new ways to create, play, and complicate the world. You just can’t see them until you get there.
