# A bad idea
What if we put a sun shield between the earth and the sun to reduce the amount of energy getting to the earth?

What if we could turn it to open up more light, or close it to reduce the amount of light?

# Its a feature not a bug
Since we already have cast a blanket of CO2 around the earth, we can use it as a regulator. If we want more heat, we let in more energy.

# Why this?
Because we will fail to reduce carbon enough.

But step back, a moment, and look at what the problem is? It's an energy problem.

# How much energy do we need to change?
Radius of Earth = 6,378 km
[Energy numbers from NASA](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/EnergyBalance/page2.php)
Solar Constant: Earth’s average distance from the Sun (about 150 million kilometers), the average intensity of solar energy reaching the top of the atmosphere directly facing the Sun is about 1,360 watts per square meter.

[Solar Constant:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_constant) It is measured by satellite as being 1.361 kilowatts per square meter (kW/m2)

[Earth absorbs](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/EnergyBalance) absorbs an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter (one watt is one joule of energy every second).

[Earth has changed 1 degree Celcius from where it should be](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/)

It takes [533,000,000 kJ](https://www.quora.com/Has-anyone-calculated-how-much-energy-is-required-to-raise-the-temperature-of-Earth-our-planet-by-one-degree) to warm the Earth 1 degree Celcius.
So I would assume it is the same amount to reduce to go down one degree Celcius.

Temperature of Space = [-270.42 Celsius](https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/universe/what-is-the-temperature-of-space.html)
Average temp on Earth = [13.9 degrees Celsius](https://www.space.com/17816-earth-temperature.html)


# How would you do this?

1. We need to put it at [Lagrange point 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point)

L1 point
The L1 point lies on the line defined between the two large masses M1 and M2. It is the point where the gravitational attraction of M2 and that of M1 combine to produce an equilibrium. An object that orbits the Sun more closely than Earth would normally have a shorter orbital period than Earth, but that ignores the effect of Earth's own gravitational pull. If the object is directly between Earth and the Sun, then Earth's gravity counteracts some of the Sun's pull on the object, and therefore increases the orbital period of the object. The closer to Earth the object is, the greater this effect is. At the L1 point, the orbital period of the object becomes exactly equal to Earth's orbital period. L1 is about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, or 0.01 au.

2. Use small craft that can collect electricity and hold it's position.

3. Produce them and place them at a reduced costs.

4. I wonder if you can get enough material from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis, only 370m in diameter
https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroid-watch/eyes-on-asteroids


# So how could this even work?

As it turns out astroids are constantly coming near us. In fact on 2029-04-13	[Apophis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis) should be about 38.0170 thousand km) give or take	±3.4 km. What if we could capture it and use it's material to build some sort of sunscreen. NOTE: The moon is [363,300 km](https://www.space.com/18145-how-far-is-the-moon.html) away so this is pretty close if we ever just wanted a bunch of rocks.  It's about the size of a giant building and is composed of sand, iron, and nickel. Here is an exerpt from [Nasa](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/apophis/in-depth/).

"Apophis is classified as an S-type, or stony-type asteroid made up of silicate (or rocky) materials and a mixture of metallic nickel and iron. Radar images suggest it is elongated and possibly has two lobes, making it look something like a peanut. Much more will be learned about this asteroid's structure following its close flyby of Earth in 2029."


Obviously the first problem is capture and moving it to L1. We have 6 years to figure that part out. It is nice that it shows up about every 7 years. So maybe we could put an engine on it when it passes by next time and then use that to alter it's orbit.

# What can you do with Nickel, Iron, and Silicon?
I'm not sure but this is where I will leave this thought experiment. The general idea is that we block sunlight from getting to the Earth, maybe by building big umberella ships, maybe by grinding up an astroid and spraying it all over L1.
