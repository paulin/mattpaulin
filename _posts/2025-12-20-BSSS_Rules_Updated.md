# Big Slice / Small Slice Rules (BSSS)

## Background
![BSSS Companion Guide](/assets/images/BSSS_with_levels.png)

The Big Slice / Small Slice (BSSS) Rules provide a simple, transparent way to track ownership and contribution accounting for a pre-filing company or early-stage project. Before legal equity exists, this model tracks who contributed what, tied to major milestones and proportional work.

The system is inspired by the idea that the project begins as a single whole—a 100% ownership “pie.” As the project progresses through milestones, slices of this pie are allocated. Contributors earn small slices of these larger slices based on their work as measured through points.

This system aligns with milestone-based equity, avoids hidden dilution, and provides an auditable and predictable accounting structure.

# Big Slice / Small Slice Rules

## 1. Big Slices

A **Big Slice** represents a major project milestone and consumes a defined percentage of the total 100% ownership.

Each Big Slice includes:

- **Release Level (RL1–RL10)** – the milestone this slice completes  
- **Slice Percentage** – the portion of the 100% ownership pie assigned to this milestone  
- **Point Budget** – total points allocated to contributors for this slice  
- **Start / End Dates** – for tracking  
- A set of contributors who earn points in this slice  

A Big Slice ends when its Release Level is achieved, not when points run out.  
You cannot create more Big Slices once 100% of ownership has been allocated.

---

## 2. Small Slices

Contributors earn **Small Slices**, representing their personal share of a Big Slice.

Ownership is calculated as:

(points earned / total points in the Big Slice) × Slice Percentage

You may increase the **Point Budget** if required to complete the milestone, but the **Slice Percentage must never change**.

---

## 3. Accounting Rules

1. The entire project has **100% ownership**.  
2. A Big Slice must declare its **Slice Percentage** when it is created.  
3. The sum of all Big Slices cannot exceed 100%.  
4. Contributors earn Small Slices based on points.  
5. All Small Slices inside a Big Slice must add up to that Big Slice’s percentage.  

---

## 4. Spreadsheet Requirements

Exports should include:

- Big Slice percentage  
- Point budget  
- Contributor points  
- Contributor Small Slice percentage  
- Cumulative contributor ownership  
- Release Level  
- Slice dates

## What Problem This Solves

As projects grow, it becomes difficult to answer simple questions:

- Who contributed what?
- How much ownership has already been earned?
- How do we reward work before the company legally exists?
- How do we avoid silent dilution or retroactive renegotiation?

The **Big Slice / Small Slice (BSSS)** system solves this by introducing a lightweight, milestone-based ownership accounting model that works **before** equity is formally issued.

It is not legal equity.  
It is a **clear, auditable precursor** to equity.

---

## Core Idea

The project starts as **100% ownership**.

That 100% is divided into **Big Slices**, each representing a major milestone in the project’s lifecycle.  
Inside each Big Slice, contributors earn **Small Slices** based on their work.

Big Slices are tied to **Release Levels (RL1–RL10)**.

---

## Roles

- **Project Owner** — defines Big Slices, assigns points, and manages milestones  
- **Members** — contribute work, earn points, and accumulate Small Slices  

---

## What This Is (and Is Not)

This is a contribution accounting system and a milestone-based ownership model.  
It is not legal equity, a cap table, or a shareholder agreement.

---

## Why BSSS Exists

BSSS provides structure, fairness, and clarity during the most ambiguous phase of a project.

Big Slices define what matters.  
Small Slices define who contributed.

Release Levels describe *product maturity*.  
Big Slices attach *ownership allocation* to achieving those levels.

Together, they form a single system for aligning progress, expectations, and contribution accounting.

---

## How Release Levels and BSSS Fit Together

- Each **Big Slice** is explicitly tied to **one Release Level**
- Completing that Release Level closes the Big Slice
- Contributors earn **Small Slices** based on work done to achieve the Release Level
- Ownership is earned through *progress*, not time

Release Levels answer:  
**“How mature is this product?”**

BSSS answers:  
**“Who contributed to getting us here?”**

# RL1 — Just an Idea

**Description**  
This is the back-of-a-cocktail-napkin stage. The idea may exist only as a conversation or a short note:  
“Hey, you know what would be cool?”

No research, validation, or commitment exists yet.

**Signals**
- Verbal concept or short written note
- No user stories
- No design
- No prototype

**BSSS Guidance**
- Typically no Big Slice yet
- Optional micro-slice if documenting or framing ideas collaboratively
- Ownership is usually not allocated here

---

# RL2 — Developed Idea

**Description**  
The idea has been shaped into something communicable. There is an elevator pitch, early user stories, and possibly rough screens or a pitch deck.

This level requires real thought, but still little commitment.

**Signals**
- Elevator pitch
- User stories
- Rough designs or flows
- Problem / solution framing

**BSSS Guidance**
- Optional small Big Slice
- Low percentage
- Focused on framing, research, and synthesis

---

# RL3 — Internal Prototype

**Description**  
The idea is tested in the cheapest possible way. The prototype may be crude, manual, or hacky, but it demonstrates the experience.

The goal is learning, not polish.

**Signals**
- Paper prototype, spreadsheet, script, or rough app
- Internal testing
- Rapid iteration
- Refined user stories

**BSSS Guidance**
- Clear Big Slice candidate
- Points rewarded for experimentation and learning
- Slice closes when the experience is demonstrable

---

# RL4 — Private Beta

**Description**  
The product is released to a small, trusted audience. Feedback is honest, sometimes painful, and invaluable.

This level answers: *Would anyone actually use this?*

**Signals**
- Friends & family users
- Real usage feedback
- Abandonment and confusion data
- Design revisions

**BSSS Guidance**
- Big Slice tied to real-world usage
- Points awarded for shipping, onboarding, and feedback loops
- Slice closes when repeat usage exists

---

# RL5 — Public Release

**Description**  
The product is available publicly. Tracking, analytics, and feedback become critical.

Criticism increases. Reality sets in.

**Signals**
- Public availability
- Analytics instrumentation
- Iterative UX fixes
- Early acquisition experiments

**BSSS Guidance**
- Larger Big Slice
- Ownership earned through shipping, stability, and iteration
- Slice closes when users reliably solve a problem with the product

---

# RL6 — You’ve Got Users

**Description**  
People are using the product regularly. You are no longer guessing who the product is for.

The challenge shifts from building to growing.

**Signals**
- Repeat usage
- Clear user segments
- Retention signals
- Early growth patterns

**BSSS Guidance**
- Big Slice tied to traction
- Points for growth experiments, infrastructure, and reliability

---

# RL7 — You Know Your Audience

**Description**  
Growth is no longer accidental. You understand who your users are and how they discover you.

The risk is now scaling too fast.

**Signals**
- Organic growth
- Clear acquisition channels
- Scaling concerns
- Infrastructure planning

**BSSS Guidance**
- Big Slice tied to scalable systems
- Points awarded for stability, performance, and growth readiness
- Slice closes when growth no longer breaks the product

---

# RL8 — Product is Scaling

**Description**  
Users onboard organically and systems hold up. Now the question becomes financial.

Does this product make money?

**Signals**
- Scalable infrastructure
- Monetization experiments
- Revenue validation attempts
- Cost modeling

**BSSS Guidance**
- Big Slice tied to monetization proof
- Ownership tied to revenue experiments and unit economics
- Slice closes when revenue matches expectations

---

**Description**  
The product has a working, repeatable business model. Growth and revenue align with projections.

This is where execution discipline matters most.

**Signals**
- Predictable revenue
- Cash flow modeling
- Improving margins
- Operational maturity

**BSSS Guidance**
- Big Slice tied to business validation
- Points rewarded for operational excellence
- Slice closes when the model holds under growth

---

# RL10 — Cash Flow Positive

**Description**  
The product sustains itself. Growth, hiring, competition, and capital strategy become the focus.

These are good problems.

**Signals**
- Cash flow positive
- Sustainable operations
- Strategic decisions
- Long-term planning

**BSSS Guidance**
- Final Big Slice(s)
- Ownership reflects long-term value creation
- System may transition to formal equity
