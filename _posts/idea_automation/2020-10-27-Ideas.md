### 10/28/20 : Debate Lab
The idea here is that you are given a topic, and a random position. You have to argue it in a structured format with another person for a 15 minute session. It would be broken up into 3 minutes for one person to talk, 3 minutes the other person, so on and so forth. Here is the catch. It is all on Twitch so people can say if they agree or disagree. Then you get some sort of rating and you can move on with it. I want the system so the most convincing people rise to the top but the real idea is for everyone to get better at structured arguments.

I was inspired by this odd bit from history. https://thepolitic.org/zoo-gone-wild-after-escobar-colombia-faces-his-hippos/ Zoo Gone Wild: After Escobar, Colombia Faces His Hippos The public was outraged by the pictures of fifteen uniformed men standing beside Pepe the Hippoâ€™s body. The most vocal protesters demanded that the Minister of Environment resign. What if you could pretend to be these characters and talk about what went well? What didn't go so well? and what would we do different next time?
