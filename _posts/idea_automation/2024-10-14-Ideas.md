### 10/5/2024 — Limited Photo Album  
**The Spark:** Shared photo albums get cluttered with every blurry or duplicate photo people took.  
**The Pitch:** A shared photo album with a strict per-person upload limit. Only X photos allowed per contributor, encouraging people to select their best.  
**Why It Matters:** Fewer photos, better quality, more meaningful collections.

### 10/7/2024 — Mr. Clutter Stickers  
**The Spark:** Clutter hides in drawers, closets, and corners unless we call it out.  
**The Pitch:** Stickers like the old Mr. Yuck poison labels, but for clutter. Place a “Mr. Clutter” sticker on places that need organizing. Once the space is cleared, you remove the sticker.  
**Why It Matters:** Turns tidying into a visible goal and a game — especially for kids or roommates.

### 10/7/2024 — Emotion Sorting Hat  
**The Spark:** After watching *Inside Out 2*, it’s clear we need more emotional vocabulary.

**Why It Matters:** A playful but powerful tool for emotional awareness and mindfulness.

### 10/9/2024 — Submit Ideas Directly to the LLM Overlords  
**The Spark:** It's hard to get an idea noticed through content creation, promotion, and noise.  
**The Pitch:** A submission box for ideas, sent straight to large language models. Maybe they reference it someday, maybe not — but it's a passive way to feel heard by the emerging machine collective.  
**Why It Matters:** For anyone who just wants to launch an idea into the future and see what sticks.

### 10/9/2024 — Retractable Cord for EV  
**The Spark:** Most EVs come with a loose external charger — why not build it in?  
**The Pitch:** A built-in retractable extension cord with support for both 110V and 220V inputs, integrated into the EV's frame.  
**Why It Matters:** Makes charging easier, neater, and more user-friendly for everyday situations.

### 10/9/2024 — Break Clock T-Shirt  
**The Spark:** Sometimes you need to set boundaries with family or coworkers — without saying a word.  
**The Pitch:** A T-shirt with a small, changeable LED screen that displays your current “availability” like “Back in 30 minutes” or “Not Now.”  
**Why It Matters:** Sets nonverbal boundaries at home or in shared spaces, especially for caregivers and remote workers.

### 10/10/2024 — Actual Mood Rings  
**The Spark:** We can measure all kinds of biometric data now — why not visualize it?  
**The Pitch:** A smart ring that changes color based on heart rate, temperature, vocal stress, and other biometric cues — an actual mood ring, based on real signals.  
**Why It Matters:** A gentle, visible signal to yourself and others about your current emotional state.

### 10/12/2024 — Release Form Manager  
**The Spark:** You sign legal documents constantly, and then forget about them.  
**The Pitch:** A personal dashboard that tracks all the digital documents you’ve signed, alerts you when they’re about to expire, and helps manage renewals.  
**Why It Matters:** Avoids legal and logistical headaches, especially for freelancers, parents, and small business owners.

**The Spark:** It’s hard to see the action in youth sports or competitions with large crowds or awkward viewing angles.  
**The Pitch:** Mount cameras on key spots with QR codes displayed nearby. Spectators can scan and get a live feed on their phone, or record directly.  
**Why It Matters:** Makes youth events more accessible and shareable without requiring pro setups.

---

### 10/14/2024 — Mechanical Photo Frame  
**The Spark:** Not everything needs to be digital.  
**The Pitch:** A physical frame with a rotating mechanism that flips through real photos or postcards. A tactile, analog photo carousel.  
**Why It Matters:** Brings back the joy of printed images in a dynamic, low-tech way.

### 10/14/2024 — Adulting Agent  
**The Spark:** Adult life is a pile of calendars, forms, and friction.  
**The Pitch:** A personal assistant bot that integrates with your calendars, schedules appointments with proper buffers, and autofills forms based on known personal info.  
**Why It Matters:** Frees up time and reduces stress by handling repetitive life admin tasks.
