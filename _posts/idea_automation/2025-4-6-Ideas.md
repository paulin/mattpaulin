### 3/11/2025 — Group Music in Coffee Shops  
**The Spark:** You’re in a coffee shop and wish you could help pick the music.  
**The Pitch:** A local-only music queue system where anyone physically present can request songs. People outside can listen in, but not influence the playlist.  
**Why It Matters:** Builds community through shared vibes, avoids abuse from remote trolls.

### 3/11/2025 — 3D Table Wedge  
**The Spark:** Wobbly tables are the worst.  
**The Pitch:** Leave behind small branded 3D-printed wedges at coffee shops to fix table wobble. The branding becomes a low-key mystery, like a street art signature.  
**Why It Matters:** A helpful, analog calling card that builds intrigue and goodwill.

### 3/13/2025 — Climbing Socks  
**The Spark:** Climbing shoes stink, but socks usually ruin the grip.  
**The Pitch:** Super-thin socks engineered for climbers — adds a layer of hygiene without compromising feel or fit.  
**Why It Matters:** Keeps shoes (and gyms) less smelly while preserving performance.

### 3/13/2025 — Gradient Descent with Quantum Computing  
**The Spark:** AI training is slow and expensive.  
**The Pitch:** Use quantum algorithms to accelerate gradient descent — the core optimization step in most AI learning.  
**Why It Matters:** Speeds up training, reduces energy costs, and pushes AI toward new frontiers.

### 3/19/2025 — “Is My Writing Interesting?” Checker  
**The Spark:** GPT models know what’s expected. So what’s unexpected?  
**The Pitch:** A tool that analyzes the probability of each word or phrase in your text. If everything is highly predictable, your writing might be boring.  
**Why It Matters:** Encourages originality, voice, and creative tension in writing.

---

### 3/20/2025 — News for Bots and from Bots  
**The Spark:** Bots are reading the news — but who’s paying the journalists?  
**The Pitch:** News organizations charge platforms for high-quality bot-readable feeds. LLMs pay premiums for timely access, and the margin goes back to the investigative work.  
**Why It Matters:** Creates a revenue model for journalism in an AI-driven world.

### 3/26/2025 — LLM Explorer  
**The Spark:** You want to know if your question is truly unique.  
**The Pitch:** A tool that shows how many others have asked similar questions to an LLM. Could be a plug-in or dashboard to visualize novelty and common paths.  
**Why It Matters:** Helps with research, creativity, and understanding the collective curiosity landscape.

---

### 3/26/2025 — Branch and Merge Call Conversations  
**The Spark:** Conversations with LLMs often go off-track.  
**The Pitch:** Built-in feature to branch off a question without polluting the original context — and merge insights later. Like Git, but for dialogue.  
**Why It Matters:** Enables deeper exploration without losing the thread or duplicating effort.

---

### 4/4/2025 — AI Re-Editing  
**The Spark:** Old films have raw potential locked inside dated cuts.  
**The Pitch:** Tokenize and label each edit and transition in a film. Then let AI rearrange scenes based on pacing, tone, or theme.  
**Why It Matters:** Breathes new life into archival footage and creates new versions with fresh perspectives.

### 4/6/2025 — To-Do Repeater  
**The Spark:** Most to-do lists forget that life is cyclical.  
**The Pitch:** A smarter to-do list that learns your repeating patterns (like “pay bills” or “refill prescriptions”) and anticipates them.  
**Why It Matters:** Saves time and mental load by automating life’s rhythms.
