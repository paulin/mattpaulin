### 5/23/20 : Video Calls for Singing
Put in a legal doc and it reads the fine print for you. Inspired by https://pca.st/episode/14281e3c-06da-40ec-82aa-ccbd9c9f6f8c

### 6/1/20 : Natural Language Processing for Legal Docs
War of the Worlds style. Basically you fake the zoom feeds to be sort of like this movie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Live

### 6/6/20 : Video Calls Faked Alien Takeover
The idea here is that it is easier to understand a group if you actually talk to them. So imagine that you sign up at a website and it ask you about your race, income level, where you live, religious views, etc. Then it pairs you with someone else and provides some conversation starter. You have a 5 min conversation and then it pops up a button that one of you can hit “extend”. If either person hits “extend” the all goes on for 5 more minutes. That’s it. You do this and commit to 5 minutes of talking to another human.

### 6/28/20 : Podding Up
Most countries have found that contact tracing is effective via mobile data. But the US is special in the fact that privacy gets in the way. What about an Opt in Network?  Install an app and people can tell if they might have been exposed?

### 7/1/20 : Opt-In Contact Tracing
The pattern is autogenerated and links to your Fitbit to set and increase/decrease pace

### 7/20/20 : Garage Band Running Music
A curated library of time series data that a person can use to get notifications about events underway. Subscription service + consulting. Business is the obvious market, but I would keep the doors open and see who shows up looking for answers in real time.

### 7/24/20 : Data Triggers
Imagine a first person perspective game where you can only hear people you are close too. I’m wondering what can be done by mashing minecraft and video calls
