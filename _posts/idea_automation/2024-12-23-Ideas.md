### 10/25/2024 — Personal Plasma Drive  
**The Spark:** After surgery, people want to help — but not everyone knows how.  
**The Pitch:** A donation system where people can give blood or plasma "in your name." It’s not a direct match, but it tracks contributions made in your honor.  
**Why It Matters:** Turns community support into a tangible resource and builds goodwill in times of need.

### 10/27/2024 — Pear Box  
**The Spark:** Pears are only ripe for a tiny window.  
**The Pitch:** A smart produce box that detects ripeness based on gas sensors or pressure — and tells you when your pears are ready.  
**Why It Matters:** Reduces waste, improves timing, and saves you from biting into a brick.

### 10/27/2024 — Candy Slow Release  
**The Spark:** You want to hand out candy for Halloween — but you also want to go out.  
**The Pitch:** A timed candy dispenser that releases treats at intervals, like a dog food feeder. Keeps trick-or-treaters happy while you’re away.  
**Why It Matters:** Participation without presence. Every house becomes a smart house.

### 10/29/2024 — Freezer Instagram  
**The Spark:** You forget what’s in the freezer until it’s too late.  
**The Pitch:** A photo-based inventory app that lets you browse what’s in your freezer like a social feed — with tags, filters, and expiration reminders.  
**Why It Matters:** Helps reduce food waste and meal planning anxiety.

### 10/29/2024 — Should I Care About Weather?  
**The Spark:** Most weather apps are overcomplicated for daily needs.  
**The Pitch:** A personalized weather app that answers one question: “Do I need to care today?” You customize your triggers — “I bike to work” or “my kid has soccer” — and it gives a simple yes/no.  
**Why It Matters:** Information tailored to your life, not generic percentages.

---

### 10/29/2024 — AI Scrubber  
**The Spark:** Sending video to customer support is risky when your space is personal.  
**The Pitch:** A tool that scans video submissions and redacts private content — faces, documents, photos on walls — before you send it.  
**Why It Matters:** Preserves privacy and makes video help tickets safer.

---

### 10/31/2024 — Halloween Tokens  
**The Spark:** Candy is fun, but what if kids could trade it for experiences?  
**The Pitch:** Buy a bag of tokens instead of candy. Kids redeem them at local businesses for treats, discounts, or even small toys.  
**Why It Matters:** Builds community and supports local shops while still delighting kids.

---

### 12/1/2024 — Fake Shopping Mall  
**The Spark:** Some people love shopping but don’t want the stuff.  
**The Pitch:** A simulated shopping experience with fake credit cards, real products, and no obligation to keep anything. You can buy for real, but you don’t have to.  
**Why It Matters:** A form of therapy, entertainment, or budgeting training — without the clutter.

---

### 12/7/2024 — Mandalorian Snowboarding Helmet  
**The Spark:** You want to look cool on the slopes and stay protected.  
**The Pitch:** A snowboarding helmet styled like Mandalorian armor, with an integrated snow visor. Functional and iconic.  
**Why It Matters:** Combines safety and fandom. Also just looks awesome.

---

### 12/7/2024 — Rock Climbing Foot Wipes  
**The Spark:** Your hands need chalk. Your feet need to not be gross.  
**The Pitch:** Portable wipes specifically for cleaning the bottom of climbing shoes before a session. Keeps holds cleaner, too.  
**Why It Matters:** Obvious product that surprisingly doesn’t exist. Hygiene meets performance.

---

### 12/23/2024 — Cozy Card Reader  
**The Spark:** Credit card machines are cold, impersonal, and ugly.  
**The Pitch:** A knit or soft covering for the reader that makes it look like a plush animal or cozy object — think Etsy meets Square.  
**Why It Matters:** Adds a bit of delight and warmth to everyday retail interactions.
