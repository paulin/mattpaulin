### 4/8/2025 — Telehug  
**The Spark:** Long-distance relationships lack physical comfort.  
**The Pitch:** A paired device that lets you send and receive a “hug” — with pressure, warmth, or even pulsing feedback. Think of it as emotional haptics.  
**Why It Matters:** Creates real intimacy across distances for partners, families, or isolated individuals.

### 4/23/2025 — Door to Other Houses  
**The Spark:** Facetime calls feel flat and impersonal for older generations.  
**The Pitch:** A vertical screen styled like a door. When both people open theirs, they “see” into each other’s space — like opening a portal. Designed for elders to feel presence, not just video.  
**Why It Matters:** Reinvents connection through spatial cues and familiar metaphors.

### 5/9/2025 — Dog Saddle with Magnet Cowboy  
**The Spark:** Dogs are fast. Cowboys are fun.  
**The Pitch:** A novelty dog saddle with a small cowboy figure held in place by magnets. When your dog runs, it’s a miniature rodeo.  
**Why It Matters:** Pure entertainment — for owners, dogs, and passersby.

### 5/10/2025 — Grilling Spatula Scabbard  
**The Spark:** Grilling is a performance. Why not make it feel epic?  
**The Pitch:** A wearable grilling spatula holster — over the back, samurai style, or belt-mounted like a sword sheath.  
**Why It Matters:** Adds flair and function to your backyard barbecue ritual.

---

### 5/12/2025 — Creatine Ice Cream  
**The Spark:** Supplements are boring, dessert is fun.  
**The Pitch:** A high-protein ice cream that includes creatine — ideal for post-workout or just leveling up snack time.  
**Why It Matters:** Merges fitness and indulgence into one cold scoop.

---

### 5/15/2025 — AI Rap Battle  
**The Spark:** What if the rap battle never had to end?  
**The Pitch:** Two AI models continually freestyling against each other, pulling from new vocabulary, trends, and cultural cues.  
**Why It Matters:** Infinite entertainment and training data for lyricists and fans alike.

---

### 5/15/2025 — AI Personal Evaluation  
**The Spark:** Self-assessment is hard. Feedback is rare.  
**The Pitch:** An AI assistant observes your day, conversations, choices, and mood — and gives you a report: strengths, blind spots, and behavioral insights.  
**Why It Matters:** A mirror for personal growth, tuned by observation, not opinion.

---

### 5/18/2025 — Pen Bandolier for My Bullet Journal  
**The Spark:** Bullet journalers are always hunting for pens.  
**The Pitch:** A soft, wearable bandolier (or strap) that fits around a journal or across the body, holding your pen lineup in place.  
**Why It Matters:** Combines organization, style, and immediate access to your tools.

---

### 5/18/2025 — Sunscreen Paintball Gun  
**The Spark:** Getting kids to wear sunscreen is a battle.  
**The Pitch:** A paintball-style gun loaded with safe, colored sunscreen. Fire once, see it stick — and know they’re covered.  
**Why It Matters:** Makes sun safety fast, visible, and (somewhat) fun.

### 5/18/2025 — AI Lost Friend  
**The Spark:** What if you could talk to someone who’s no longer around?  
**The Pitch:** An AI model trained on a person’s voice and personality (with consent) so you can hold conversations that feel like the real thing — whether for grief processing, nostalgia, or storytelling.  
**Why It Matters:** A profound tool for memory, connection, and even legacy.
