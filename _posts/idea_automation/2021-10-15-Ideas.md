### 10/19/21 : Birthday Bot
Put in all your relatives names/birthdates. It reminds you 2 weeks before to buy something or do something. BONUS.

### 10/25/21 : Internet Sales Bell
Since everyone is virtual, no longer does it make sense to have a gong in an office to announce a sale. (Not that it ever really did but bear with me). This would be the web equivalent. Basically, when a sale happens the sales person pushes a button. Then a bunch of stuff happens. TBD. Probably an API so you can tie it to your favorite clown service, or confetti release device.
