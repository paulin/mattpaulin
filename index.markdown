![Hi](/assets/images/cartoonmatt.png){:width="30%"}

I’m Matt Paulin, I have created companies, developed software, and launched products for 20 years. My background originally was in Electrical Engineering at Kansas State. Currently I’m looking for groups that are building software product or any group that is working with OKRs. I am very interested in climate fixes, improving education, and autonomous vehicles.

I love to build impactful products and businesses and am happy to share what I have learned. I also love building communities and helping people grow their own businesses. If there is a resource you are looking for, please reach out to me. I'm always happy to help.

You can learn more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattpaulin/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} here or reach out to me and I'm happy to take some time to talk with you.
