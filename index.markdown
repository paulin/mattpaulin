I’m Matt Paulin, I have created companies, developed software, and launched products for 20 years. My background originally was in Electrical Engineering at Kansas State. Currently I’m looking for groups that need help organizing software projects, any group that is working with OKRs. I am very interested in climate fixes, improving education, and autonomous vehicles.

I love to build impactful products and businesses. I'm happy to share what I have learned. If I can't help you with your project then I'm sure I can introduce you to someone who can.

You can learn more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattpaulin/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} here or reach out to me and I'm happy to take some time to talk with you.
